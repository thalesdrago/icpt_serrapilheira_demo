data(World)
# package tmap has a syntax similar to ggplot. The functions start all with tm_. It has a sintax similar to ggplot2
tm_shape(World) +
  tm_borders()

# A simple examination with head(), str() or dplyr::glimpse() can tell us the class,
# dimensions, and other characteristics of object World.
# Features are the rows and the fields are the colunms
head(World)
names(World)
class(World)
dplyr::glimpse(World)

# What happens when you execute plot(World)?
# How would you plot only one of the variables? What happens when you execute
plot(World)
plot(World[,1]) # plot[i] or plot [,i] will plot the all features and for the i field
plot(World[1,]) # plot[i,] will plot the 1 feature and all i fields
plot(World["pop_est"])

#A key difference between data frames and sf objects is the presence of geometry,
# that looks like a column when printing the summary of any sf object
head(World[, 1:4])

# When calling World$geometry, however, we perceive itâ€™s not a single column.
# Actually, geometries are a class in their own, sfc

# We can tranform World to a data frame by taking geometry out

# Using dplyr sintax
